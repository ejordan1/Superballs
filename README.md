Below is a link to video of the gameplay from which this last screenshot was taken. Right click the music link and select "open link in new tab" and click over to it to get it going. Then open the gameplay link and set the resolution to at least 1080p. 1440p is best.
3 minutes 50 seconds is when it begins to get slightly outrageous.
