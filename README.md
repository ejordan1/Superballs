# _Superballs_

#### _Real-time physics based graphics performance software_

#### By _**Emerson Jordan**_

## Description

_You launch shapes into the game screen, and then manipulate these shapes in various ways within the physics engine.

A beta of this project is avaiable to play as a webgl build (but it takes 45 seconds to get going) at https://emersonjordan.itch.io/od
The reason for the 45 seconds is that once you launch several thousand object onto the screen it freezes while the browser
allocates more ram. (The released version will be avaiable for download...) It might seem like it won't ever fix itself but on Chrome Browser it does. (try to keep it under 5000 balls)

Both of these images are screen shots from what is being generated and manipulated by the player in real time.
